    <h1>Vo, Kevin</h1>
    <p>My name is Kevin Vo and I'm from Santa Clara, CA, which is located just outside of San Francisco. I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder with interests in computational mathematics. I also am studying Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology and enjoy merging aspects of the scientific process with engineering in my approach to problem solving. When I'm not on the computer, I generally like to be outside in the sun. Some of my favorite things to do include basketball, tennis, gaming, hiking, skiing, and backpacking.</p>
